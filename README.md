In above code, min heap data structure is implemented and for the parent, left/right functions used bit manipulation operators.
In addition, it have the following functionality:
- The ability to initially build the heap (build_min_heap)
- The ability to heapify
- The ability to get and remove ("pop") the root node from the heap (and of course re-heapify everything)
- The heap should be generic to the type of data (can store floats, int, custom datastructure)
